# Tenable Cloud Security GitHub Action - IaC Sync (Terraform)

Use this GitHub Action to sync from Cloud to Code so that you can trace your cloud resources and issues back to
their code origins. Doing so can help you see which resource is the source of a detected risk, identify the owner, and
clearly see what needs to be fixed.
